# About DigiCeipt-FE-PJT-57

The Digital receipt app as the name implies will help merchants to generate digital copies of receipt for every transaction made. It is specially made for merchants who sell online (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Telegram. etc). This way they can keep track of all their transactions electronically and also send receipts to their customers via e-mail or other electronic means.
